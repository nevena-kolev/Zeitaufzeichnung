** As a user I want...
	- to see a list of all my tasks,
	- to distinguish between finished (marked gray) and active tasks,
	- my tasks to be sorted by name,
	- to be able to hide the finished ones, but they should still be accessible for
	  me if I need to make changes,
	- to have an overview of both a list and of the time spent on a task,
	- to switch between these two views in a few steps only,
	- to have a menu in which I can log out, go to my settings and delete tasks,
	- to tap on a task to edit it,
	- to get a popup where I can create a new task with useful information.
